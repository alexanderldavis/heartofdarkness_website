						<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>
						<p>Mapping Marlow's Journey<br />

									<h2>Mouth of the Thames (London)</h2>
									<p>"This ... has been one of the dark places of the earth"</p>
								</header>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u$(2)">
                                <p>Serving primarily as a framing device, the discussion between Marlow, the Lawyer, the Accountant and the unknown narrator introduces the main message of the novel. As their surroundings become “less brilliant but more profound” (2) with the setting sun, the narrator’s thoughts turns to the glories of mankind. Specifically, the “greatness [that] had … floated on the ebb of [the Thames] into the mystery of an unknown earth” (2). While the narrator thinks of the conquests of civilized man, Marlow reveals a contrasting opinion: that this “has been one of the dark places of the earth” (3).</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u$ 12u$(2)">
								<p>Although Marlow quickly reveals that he speaks specifically of the suffering of the colonizing men who were sent there to discover the land and must have suffered, the sentence also exposes the concept that the action of “civilizing” is often hypocritical. In this sense, Marlow has created the message that is continually referred to throughout his journey: “civilized” men do not act in favor of those they are “helping.” In other words, to those they enslave, kill, or abuse, Marlow and “his kind” are the manifestation of evil and darkness.</p>

						<h2>Brussels</h2>
						<p>"I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre"</p>
					</header>
					<p>In Brussels, the city that to Marlow resembles a mausoleum, the hypocrisy of the conquests of man are apparent but take a different form. When Marlow visits the company headquarters in the city, he encounters the two knitting receptionists, who seem to be “guarding the door of darkness” (8 in A’s). This interpretation is very interesting, as though Marlow is concerned that his assignment may prove too dangerous, he still considers the company the epitome of darkness.</p>

						<h2>London</h2>
						<p>"I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work -- to get a job. Heavens!"</p>
					</header>
					<p>Marlow’s Aunt has the connections to get him the job with the company. She also acts as the only female figure with any importance towards Marlow or otherwise in the novel. After her advice of being careful among the savages, he thinks, “it’s queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own…”(page 18). His Aunt is revealed to be very opinionated of the savages and the life they live, however doesn’t seem to matter considering Marlow’s view on women is that they have no concept to the real world. It’s very contradicting seeing as his Aunt was the one who got him his job, however her importance and women’s importance in general is miniscule to Marlow, and assumedly most men of that epoch.</p>

                    <p>"There she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent"</p>
                </header>
                <p>	Along the coast of Africa, the “battle” between civility and savagery is evident. The French man-of-war that fired its guns into the coast to attack the “enemies simultaneously promotes two concepts. First, the attack shows that the colonists are ruthless and use their technological advances to scare the natives. Second, as described by Marlow, “there was a touch of insanity to the proceedings” (11). This highlights the enormity of the land to be ‘civilized,’ and Marlow is concerned that firing at the natives - the “enemies” - is the wrong approach. It is insane to attack the coast of a continent simply to issue a warning: this is just one of the indications of mental deprivation in the colonial proceedings.</p>

                    <p>"At last we opened a reach. A jetty projected into the river"</p>
                </header>
                <p>The theme of civility versus savagery is clear at this moment in the story as well. The Congo river, Marlow understands, is more difficult to travel into than it is to escape. In this sense, the Congo River is a symbol for danger, and tries to prevent Marlow and company from entering the “Heart of Darkness.” The deeper he goes into the “heart of darkness”, the more he realizes about the natural darkness that humanity has.</p>

                </header>
                <p>This location serves as the key argument against the humanity of the “civilized men.” Here, Marlow makes it evident that to the slaves of the Congo, Marlow and his fellow colonists are truly the manifestation of darkness. The natives are slaves, who are allowed reprieve from their duties only to “die in the shade.” Conrad introduces some distinction between Marlow and the other colonists, as Marlow gives the slave he meets something to eat.</p>

                </header>
                <p>As Marlow learns more details concerning Kurtz, it is clear that Marlow feels admiration towards Kurtz. This is particularly surprising, as Marlow had originally felt guilt for partaking in an expedition that hurts the native population (when speaking with his aunt). Furthermore, Marlow makes a connection of his current location to his previous discussion with the doctor in Brussels, saying that his journey has become “scientifically interesting.” By making his presence there, as well as the actions committed by his counterparts a “scientific oddity,” Marlow distances himself from blame. The location and savagery of the location caused Marlow and the other colonists to detach from reality, which justifies their atrocious actions.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Marlow’s anticipation to meet Kurtz is matched with the Russian trader’s high admiration for Kurtz. Marlow experiences meeting a man who was once civilized, but now is a very successful savage. He is intrigued by “that man,” as Marlow explains, “His name, you understand, had not been pronounced once. He was ‘that man,’” (page 55). It puts in perspective for Marlow the different types of lives that exists, that the civilized man's world is not the only option, that this successful man was able to become something great without following the typical route.</p>

                <p>Marlow’s encounter with Kurtz reveals the darkness that exists within humanity. Savagery in the society in which Kurtz surrounds himself in is acceptable, as opposed to the civilization from which Marlow originates, where murder and savagery are frowned upon. Marlow describes himself as being transported into a “lightless region of subtle horrors.” He also says that the wilderness whispered to Kurtz “things he did not know about himself” showing the “dark” side of Kurtz.</p>

                <p>Kurtz’s blindness, followed by his last words “the horror, the horror” reveal “the horror” that exists in the darkness. Until the darkness is experienced, the light keeps everything good and pure. It is only after Kurtz goes blind does he recognize his brutality and “the horror” of his actions. The “light no longer shone into Kurtz’s eyes,” and “the darkness of his heart overcame him.”</p>
